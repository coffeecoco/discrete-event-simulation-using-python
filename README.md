There is a NIC queue that acts as a server to 5 customers with different priorities. The customers use the server indefinitely using either NIC or other resources. In case of same priority we use FIFS principle. Each process finishes with following the exponential distribution with same rate Lambda Î» = 0.1/sec when using other resources. And finishes with Mu u = 1/sec when using the NIC.
